    - **Hazardous Weather Outlook (HWO):** Events valid within 48 hours may be referenced in HWO. Coastal hazards not expected within 48 hours addressed as outlook.
    - **Short Term Forecast (NOW):** Coastal hazard information brief and augments CFW, not replaces.
    - **Tropical Cyclone Local Watch/Warning Product (TCV) and Hurricane Local Statement (HLS):** CFW issued when tropical cyclone watches/warnings are in effect, providing inundation ranges consistent with TCV/HLS.

**3. Water Level Observations and Dissemination**

- **Tide and Water Level Observations:** Real-time access important. WFOs/WSOs maintain contact with local officials for data. Familiarity with terminology. NOS collects and distributes real-time tidal observations and predictions (tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov).
- **Tide and Water Level Reports:** Routine tide reports issued using AWIPS product identifier TID. Tide data can be appended to Coastal/Lakeshore Message during significant coastal events. Reference standard datums (e.g., MLLW).
- **Great Lakes Water Levels:** Data from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and NOS.
- **NWS Great Lakes Water Level Report:** Periodic reports issued using AWIPS product identifier OMR.
