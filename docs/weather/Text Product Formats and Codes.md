This document outlines the format and codes for National Weather Service (NWS) text products, particularly those intended for public dissemination.

## National Weather Service Instruction 10-1701: Text Product Formats and Codes

### Introduction to NWS Text Products

This instruction defines the rules for formats and codes used in NWS text products formatted according to World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards for public release. These formats include communication headers and trailers, geographic identifiers, event codes, and the main narrative text. Products are generated by the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) and other systems.

**Exclusions:**

- Technically-oriented text products (aviation, forecast guidance, internal use, summaries, reports with embedded data, XML/markup language products).

**Supplementary References:**

- Interface Control Document (ICD) - "AWIPS NWWS-2 Configuration" available at [https://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwws/updates.html](https://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwws/updates.html).
- NWSI 10-1702, Universal Geographic Code (UGC) - provides comprehensive UGC details.
- NWSI 10-1703, Valid Time Event Code (VTEC) - provides rules and examples for VTEC.

**Mission Connection (Section 1.1):** Correct use of product formats and codes is vital for the timely delivery of warnings, watches, forecasts, and other weather/non-weather-related information to protect life and property, supporting the "all-hazards" concept.

**Languages Other Than English (Section 1.2):** This instruction covers American English. NWS Regions, National Centers, WFOs, WSOs, and RFCs developing non-English products will create standard translations in cooperation with user groups.

**Format of Text Examples (Section 1.3):**

- **Actual ASCII text:** `UPPER CASE` (Courier New font)
- **Code groups:** `lowercase` (Courier New font)
- **Text placeholders:** `_lowercase italicized_` (Times New Roman font inside brackets)
- **Printable punctuation/symbols:** `_($$)_` (underscore in Courier New font)
- **Blank spaces:** `TORNADO WARNING` (Courier New font inside parentheses)
- **ASCII control characters:** `<cr>` (lowercase Courier New font inside brackets)

### Overall Product Format Rules (Section 3)

- **Left Justification (3.1):** Major blocks are left-justified. Exceptions for narrative content (e.g., bullet format) are covered in Product Specification documents.
- **End-of-Line Characters (3.2):** All lines end with `<cr><cr><lf>` (carriage return, carriage return, line feed). AWIPS systems provide these automatically.
- **Length of Line (3.3):** 69 characters or less (recommended 66 characters for actual text, excluding EOL characters).
- **Length of Product (3.4):** Under 15,000 characters when feasible. Longer products may be segmented.
- **End-of-Report Characters (3.5):** An equal sign (`=`) followed by an end-of-line character (`<cr><cr><lf>`) marks the end of discrete parts in certain products (e.g., observations, TAFs), and can also be used for segmentation.
- **Blank Lines (3.6):** Used to separate major format blocks and distinctive lines for readability:
    - Between AWIPS Product Identifier and Mass News Disseminator (MND) Block.
    - Between MND Block and product content block.
    - Following segment header block in segmented products.
    - Before and after `&&` (double ampersand).
    - Before and after `$$` (double dollar).
    - Before and after Call-to-Action markers.

#### Universal Geographic Code (UGC) (Section 3.7)

- **Purpose:** Specifies the affected geographic area (state, county/parish "C" form, or NWS zone "Z" form) and product expiration time.
- **Placement:**
    - **Non-segmented products:** Immediately after the AWIPS Product Identifier, followed by VTEC string(s) if required.
    - **Segmented products:** At the beginning of each segment's narrative text, followed by VTEC string(s) (if required), plain language geographic names, and a repeat of the issuance date/timeline. The first segment's UGC follows the MND Block.
- Full details in NWSI 10-1702.

#### Valid Time Event Code (VTEC) (Section 3.8)

- Used in event-driven NWS text products (watches, warnings, advisories) for automated parsing.
- Identifies event characteristics: operational/experimental/test, action, issuing office, phenomenon/significance, tracking number, beginning/ending time.
- Appears on the line(s) immediately following each UGC string.
- Full details in NWSI 10-1703.

#### Events, Segments, and Products (Section 3.9)

- **Definitions (3.9.1):**
    - **Event:** Specific combination of phenomenon (e.g., weather type) and significance level (e.g., Watch, Warning, Advisory). Examples: Tornado Warning, Flood Warning.
    - **Segment:** A part of a segmented product that applies to a unique geographic area, including UGC, VTEC, plain language names, and Date/Timeline.
    - **Product:** The entire message issued under a single MND header, which may contain information on one or more events.
- **Product Expiration Time vs. Event Ending Time (3.9.2):**
    - **Product Expiration Time:** Time after which a product/segment should no longer be used (purge time), typically at the end of the UGC string. For W/W/A products, should not exceed 24 hours from issuance.
    - **Event Ending Time:** Time when the event is no longer valid for a given area, found in the narrative and in the P-VTEC string.
- **Time Zone Indicators `<tz>` (3.9.3):** Used in MND and segment header blocks, headlines, body of short-duration warnings, and when multiple time zones are mentioned.
    - Format: `<time>_AM_<tz>` or `<time>_PM_<tz>` or `<time>_UTC`
    - See Table 2 for names and indicators (e.g., EST, CDT, AKST).
- **Multiple Time Zones Within W/W/A Products (3.9.4):** Avoided where possible to prevent confusion.
    - **Single Time Zone Product/Segment:** Use only the time zone of the segment/product.
    - **Multiple Time Zones in Product/Segment (Narrative):** Specific times mentioned in text will be followed by both time zones in the format: `<time>_xM_<tz1>_/<time>_xM_<tz2>/`.
    - **Multiple Time Zones in Segment Header Issuance Date/Time:** Either use both time zones in format `<time>_xM_<tz1>_day_mon_<dd>_year_/<time>_xM_<tz2>_day_mon_<dd>_year/`, or use the issuing office's time zone.
    - **Multiple Time Zones in MND Issuance Date/Time:** Use the issuing office's time zone.

### Product Header Blocks (Section 4)

#### AWIPS Product Identifier (Section 4.1)

- Uniquely identifies the product, area, originating office, and issuance time.
- Comprises:
    - **Start-of-Message Code (4.1.1):** Double pound sign (`##`) in this document.
    - **WMO Abbreviated Heading (4.1.2):** `ttaaii_cccc_ddhhmm_bbb`
        - `ttaaii`: Data type/location (e.g., `tt` for data type, `aa` for geographical/data type/time, `ii` for differentiation).
        - `cccc`: International 4-letter identifier of issuing office (e.g., `KLWX`).
        - `ddhhmm`: Product issuance date/time in UTC.
        - `bbb`: Designator for original transmission vs. retransmissions (AAx for amended/updated, CCx for corrected, RRx for delayed/repeated).
    - **AWIPS Identifier (AI) (4.1.3):** `nnnxxx`
        - `nnn`: Specific 3-character product category.
        - `xxx`: 3-character NWS Location Identifier (NWSLI) of originating office.
- In non-segmented products, UGC string appears immediately after AI, followed by VTEC string(s). UGC and VTEC are NOT part of the AWIPS Product Identifier.

#### Mass News Disseminator (MND) Header Block (Section 4.2)

- **Issuance Date/Time Line (4.2.5):** `<hhmm>_xM_<tz>_day_mon_<dd>_year` (local time) or `<hhmm>_UTC_day_mon_<dd>_year` (UTC). See Table 8 for details.

#### Segment Header Block (Section 4.3)

- Used in segmented products to define valid area, time period, and events for that segment.
- Consists of:
    - **UGC String (4.3.1):** First line(s) of the segment.
    - **VTEC String(s) (4.3.2):** Immediately following UGC string when applicable.
    - **UGC Associated Plain Language Names (4.3.3):** Zone/county/parish/independent city names, optionally with state abbreviations.
    - **Issuance Date/Time Line (4.3.4):** Normally same as MND block, but can include up to two time zones for segments spanning multiple zones.

### Product Content Block (Section 5)

The main informational part of the product, appearing after the MND block (and a blank line) and before the communications trailer.

- **Headlines (5.1):** One or more headlines for the narrative/data, preceded and followed by ellipses (...). Most important event listed first. Blank line separates headlines from content.
- **Explicit Time-of-Day References in Text (5.2):** `<hhmm>_xM_<tz>` or `<hhmm>_UTC`. Time zone indicator can be optional unless short duration warning, multiple time zones, or potential confusion. `NOON` and `MIDNIGHT` used instead of `12_PM` and `12_AM`.

- **Communications Trailer (6.2):** End-of-message code (double asterisk `**` in this document).

### Test and Practice Message Wording (Section 7)

Standardized language for test and practice messages is crucial to prevent confusion and panic.

- **Test Messages (7.1):**
    - **VTEC String (7.1.1):** Uses `T` fixed identifier.
    - **MND Header Block (7.1.2):** Includes `TEST` wording as per Table 7.
    - **Headlines (7.1.3):**
        - Boilerplate: `...THIS_MESSAGE_IS_FOR_TEST_PURPOSES_ONLY...` (after MND header and segment header).
        - Actual Headlines: If present, will include `TEST` at beginning and end (e.g., `...TEST_BLIZZARD_WARNING IN_EFFECT_UNTIL_11_AM_MDT_THIS_MORNING_TEST...`).
    - **Free Text, including Bullets (7.1.4):** `THIS_IS_A_TEST_MESSAGE` at beginning of each line (with exceptions).
    - **End of Segment Boilerplate:** `THIS_IS_A_TEST_MESSAGE. DO_NOT_TAKE_ACTION_BASED_ON_THIS_TEST_MESSAGE.` (before `$$` or `LAT...LON`).
- **Practice Messages (7.2):** Contain same test wording as test mode.
- **Recovery After Inadvertent Test or Practice Message is Sent (7.3):**
    1.  Immediately cancel/retract the errant WMO product using the prescribed follow-up product. If VTEC events were included, cancel them.
    2.  State in the follow-up product that the errant product was issued in error and that no significant weather/hazardous event is expected.
    3.  Issuing office performs notifications and files a Significant Event Report (NWSI 10-1603).

### Recommended Actions for Inadvertent NWS Dissemination (Section 8)

For high-visibility WMO-formatted text products disseminated inadvertently by NWS offices (false warnings, tests without proper wording, etc.):

- **Weather Message (8.1):**
    1.  Immediately cancel the errant WMO product using the prescribed follow-up product, canceling VTEC events if applicable.
    2.  State in the follow-up product that it was issued in error and no significant weather/hazardous event is expected.
    3.  Notify regional headquarters (WFO/RFC/CWSU) or NWSOC/SDM (NCEP Centers) for coordination and escalation.
- **Non-Weather Emergency Message (NWEM) (8.2):**
    1.  If NWEM not via NWS systems: WFO contacts external entity to coordinate recovery steps. NWS offers assistance but takes no further action unless requested.
    2.  If NWEM via NWS systems: Contact external entity to coordinate recovery message and dissemination method, ensuring identical messaging. NWS should issue an Administrative Message (ADR) if the external authority does for recovery.
    3.  Notify regional headquarters for coordination and escalation.
- **Examples of Recovery Messages (8.3):** Provides standard language for minimizing confusion and avoiding explanations for errors.

### Steps to Take After Incorrect Dissemination by a Third Party (Section 9)

For correctly-formatted NWS messages incorrectly disseminated by third parties (e.g., a test message appearing as a real warning):

- NWS office issuing the original message will take the following steps: (Document does not list specific steps in this section, but likely refers to the general notification and communication procedures.)
- WFO/RFC/CWSU contacts regional headquarters; National Center contacts SDM and NWSOC.
- Regional headquarters ensures all impacted offices are aware.

### Steps to Take for Messaging After Inadvertent Dissemination of Test Alerts by a Third Party (Section 10)

If a field office is aware of third-party incorrect dissemination of an NWS test alert (but not directly responding to inquiry):

- Issue a statement (e.g., via Facebook, Twitter) only if individual inquiries cannot be reasonably responded to.
- **Standard Message (e.g., Facebook):** "The National Weather Service (NWS) does not have a {type of alert or warning} in effect for the {identifying information} area at this time. NWS did issue a TEST {type of alert or warning}. We are aware that a third party provider may have disseminated this alert without the TEST designation to its client[s] which may have been shared with others. If and when NWS issues an official warning, they are broadcast on NOAA Weather Radio and are posted on WFO web pages, accessible via weather.gov. As appropriate, Wireless Emergency Alerts, NOAA Weather Radio tone alerts, or television crawl message systems may also be activated. The NWS is the official federal government source of weather watches, warnings, and advisories to the public for the protection of life and property."
- **Tweeted Message (if warranted):** "There is no NWS {type of alert or warning} warning in effect for {area} at this time. See {office webpage URL} for the latest." followed by "NWS warnings are broadcast on NOAA Weather Radio and may trigger Wireless Emergency Alerts, NWR tone alerts, or television crawls. See {office webpage URL} for the latest."
- Refer media inquiries to NWS Public Affairs (301-427-9000).

### Role of NWS Rapid Response Team (Section 11)

- NWSOC and regional headquarters/National Centers determine if inadvertent message dissemination is significant.
- For significant errors, NWSOC notifies the NWS Rapid Response Team (RRT) at NWS headquarters.
- RRT prepares a holding statement for public/media inquiries, which is shared with regional headquarters and affected offices.
- NWS offices MUST use the exact wording of the approved holding statement.
- Until approved statement is distributed, offices should only identify current watches, warnings, advisories in effect for their area and refer additional media questions to NWS Public Affairs.
