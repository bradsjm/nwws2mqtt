This document, "NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INSTRUCTION 10-601," dated April 25, 2023, outlines the specifications and procedures for Weather Forecast Office (WFO) Tropical Cyclone Products. It supersedes the previous instruction dated July 14, 2022.

## Weather Forecast Office (WFO) Tropical Cyclone Products

WFOs issue tropical cyclone products to inform media, local decision makers, and the public about current and anticipated tropical cyclone conditions within their County Warning Area (CWA). They are also responsible for issuing tropical cyclone wind watches and warnings for inland portions of their CWA. Coastal Atlantic basin WFOs, along with WFO San Juan, Puerto Rico, collaborate with the National Hurricane Center (NHC) for storm surge watches and warnings. All products must be consistent with the latest guidance from the respective tropical cyclone forecast center and surrounding offices.

### 1.1 WFO Tropical Cyclone Local Watch/Warning Product (WFO TCV)

TCVs are issued by WFOs with tropical cyclone wind watch/warning responsibility, with the exception of WFO Guam and WSO Pago Pago.

## 3. Procedures for Populating Wind Forecast Grids for Tropical Cyclone Events

Updates planned for better integration into NDFD.

### 3.1 Wind Speed Values Within the 34-knot Wind Radii

- **0 to 120 hours:** Field offices use designated wind tool and latest NHC/CPHC/JTWC advisory wind radii. Do not exceed official radii. If radii unavailable, use climatology-persistence model output or coordinate. Not necessary once system is post-tropical or dissipated.
- **Storm Intensity:** Use full continuum of values, up to max sustained wind speed in forecast advisory. Do not exceed.
- **Local Knowledge:** Apply local knowledge/mesoscale expertise to explicit wind speed forecasts within stated constraints.
- **121 to 168 hours:** Use Radii Climatology and Persistence Model (RCL) wind tool, capping at 45 knots. If RCL points unavailable, collaborate for background closest to NHC/WPC points, capping at 45 knots.

### 3.2 Wind Speed Values Outside the 34 knot Wind Radii

- **0 to 168 hours:** Use deterministic wind speed values.

### 3.3 Wind Direction Values Inside or Outside the 34 knot Wind Radii

- **0 to 168 hours:** Use deterministic wind direction values.

### 3.4 Wind Gust Values Inside or Outside the 34 knot Wind Radii

Wind gust grids are required, created via local GFE. Methodology and values should be collaborated.

### 3.5 Caveat

Emphasize for all text/graphical products: "Winds in and near tropical cyclones should be used with caution due to uncertainty in forecast track, size, and intensity."

---

## 4. Procedures for Tropical Cyclone Storm Surge Watch/Warning Collaboration with NHC

Instructions for Atlantic basin coastal WFOs only. Updates planned for NDFD integration.

### 4.1 Collaboration Initiation

NHC informs affected WFOs when storm surge inundation values approach watch/warning criteria.

### 4.2 Collaborative Process

NHC sends proposed storm surge grids (Proposed SS grids) via AWIPS GFE. WFOs edit for local area and send back. Second round of collaboration if needed. NHC makes final determination for disagreements.

### 4.3 Finalization of Storm Surge Watches/Warnings

WFOs finalize surge hazards before advisory time. Added to local WFO Hazards grid and used in TCV product (AWIPS GFE text formatter). Storm surge watches/warnings must begin/end at zone boundaries. If part of a zone is impacted by surge watch/warning, no other coastal flood hazard can be in effect for that zone. Other coastal hazards are allowed.
